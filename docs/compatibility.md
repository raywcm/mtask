# Compatibility

Updated: 2026-10-28

## Platforms

| Platform | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS arm64 | Tested locally | Core terminal and process regression suites passed. |
| Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS arm64 | Tested on a server | Core terminal and process regression suites passed. SSH disconnect/reconnect was also tested. |
| Linux amd64 | Cross-built | CI results are available in [Actions](https://github.com/raywcm/taskdock/actions). |
| macOS amd64 | Cross-built | Native Intel Mac testing is pending. |
| Debian / RPM-based distributions | Package contents checked | Native package-manager install, upgrade and removal tests are pending. |

Builds disable CGO. The minimum Go version is 1.26; local testing used Go 1.27.3.
Go is not required at runtime.

## Applications and terminals

| Application / environment | Tests run | Coverage still needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POSIX shell / Bash | Input/output, exit codes, Ctrl+C, job cleanup and reconnect | Shell customizations and plugins |
| Vim | Unicode editing, detach, reconnect and saving | Plugins and additional terminal extensions |
| htop | Static screen content after repeated reconnects | Other ncurses applications |
| Incremental full-screen test program | Static cells, terminal modes and reconnect redraw | Additional VT extensions |
| Codex 0.164.0-alpha.11.1 / OpenCode 1.18.30 | Startup and mixed-session attach/detach; original PIDs preserved | Interactive workflows, mouse and keyboard behavior |
| xterm-256color with a real PTY and pyte decoder | Main/alternate buffers, cursor, Unicode and redraw | GUI terminal behavior |
| SSH to Ubuntu ARM64 | Lost client connection, reconnect and process identity | Host-specific login-session cleanup policies |
| Tabby and other GUI terminals | Manual observations and bug reports | Systematic scrollback, selection, clipboard and mouse tests |

The Codex/OpenCode check used six mixed tasks and two attach rounds without
submitting model requests. OpenCode produced no output during the short direct
startup check, so its visible startup still needs testing.

## Known limitations

- **Host shutdown ends tasks.** Brokers survive terminal closure and SSH loss
  when the host permits background user processes. Reboot, OOM and login-session
  cleanup can terminate them.
- **Reattach relies on application redraw.** tdock restores known terminal modes
  and briefly changes the PTY size to request a redraw. It does not restore a
  full screen snapshot or host-terminal scrollback. Unsupported extensions or an
  application that does not redraw can leave an incomplete screen.
- **Monitoring changes the PTY size.** The preview uses its pane size and retains
  that size when leaving. Full attach applies the full terminal size. Occupied
  or unreachable tasks display “Unable to monitor.” The preview is reconstructed
  from retained logs and accepts keyboard input immediately. ↑/↓ selects the monitored task and Esc/F12 returns to the list;
  these keys are reserved in the monitor. Native
  mouse behavior and unsupported terminal extensions require fullscreen attach.
- **Connection roles are scoped to one Unix account.** Read-only limits that
  connection; the same account can open another management client. Shared inputs
  can interfere. The oldest connected controller determines the PTY size.
- **History has limits.** Stopped records and logs expire after one hour by
  default. Use `tdock settings set history-retention off` to retain them.
  Each task keeps two output files of approximately 8 MiB each.
- **A lost broker cannot recover its PTY.** `recover` reconciles stale metadata
  without signalling old PIDs. Descendants that detached from the managed
  session may need manual cleanup after a broker crash.
- **Existing brokers keep their code after an upgrade.** New tasks use the new
  executable. Ordinary attach works with protocol-v1 brokers; takeover,
  read-only and shared modes require v0.3.0 or later.
- **SIGKILL prevents frontend cleanup.** Normal Ctrl+C/INT/TERM/HUP exits restore
  terminal state. A killed frontend may leave modes that need a terminal reset.

See [testing](stability.md) for reproduction commands and [usage](usage.md) for
configuration and recovery procedures.

## Coding agents

Codex, Claude Code and OpenCode launch as ordinary terminal commands. No
agent-specific integration is required. Native attach forwards their output and
input; monitor control uses a separate screen renderer.

The current demo was recorded on macOS arm64 with three Codex CLI 0.165.0
sessions and two OpenCode 1.18.30 sessions, alongside htop, shells and servers. Startup, typing in the prompt and detach/reconnect are checked without
submitting a model request. Claude Code was not installed in this environment;
its full workflow has not been tested here.

A shared native terminal has one PTY size. Use monitor panes for differently
sized windows; followers crop the owner’s screen without resizing the program.
The OS or terminal must pass Shift+Up/Down through for those monitor bindings.
